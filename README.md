TO-DO Website

This To-Do List site is one of the projects I created while learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to make something useful and interactive, and a to-do application
seemed like the ideal challenge to assist me in refining my skills and knowledge of how frontend development operates.

The primary concept of this project was to build a simple and easy-to-use task manager where users could add, finish, and remove tasks. I have used HTML to organize the app, CSS to 
design it and make it pretty, and JavaScript to manage all the interactivity. Every aspect of the project was a learning experience—from dealing with user input and dynamically updating
the DOM to dealing with events such as button clicks and form submissions.

One of the best things about it was discovering how to implement local storage so that the tasks wouldn't be lost when the page was refreshed. This was my initial foray into learning 
how to store user data in the browser, and it made the app feel much more functional and complete.

From this project, I honed writing cleaner, better-organized code and crafting a responsive layout that functions on desktop and mobile seamlessly. I also gained experience on how 
little details—such as animations, hover effects, and basic validations—can make a difference to the user experience.

This To-Do List site might be small, but it's a milestone in my web development learning process. It enabled me to gain confidence in dealing with fundamental technologies and 
experience the satisfaction of bringing ideas to life in code.
